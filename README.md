DEMO: https://priceless-stonebraker-336bc4.netlify.app

In this app, order data is stored using the firebase.
However, logging in, registering and adding cards is intentionally only simulated by me.
I wanted to this data to disappear after refreshing the page and not to clutter.
You can choise size your bike and colors. Have fun! 👨‍💻
