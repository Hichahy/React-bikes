About the application
This is a simulation of a bicycle shop.
Admin can manage product cards.
He can add and remove cards and check & deleted orders,
but only after logging in as admin.

admin@admin.com

In this app, order data is stored using the firebase.
However, logging in, registering and adding cards is intentionally only simulated by me.
I wanted to this data to disappear after refreshing the page and not to clutter.
You can choise size your bike and colors. Have fun! 👨‍💻
